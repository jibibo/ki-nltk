this is george
he lived in africa
he was very happy
but he had one fault
he was too curious
one day george saw a man
he had on a large yellow straw hat
the man saw george too
what a nice little monkey
he thought 
i would like to take him home with me
the man put his hat on the ground and of course george was curious
he came down from the tree to look at the large yellow hat
the hat had been on the man's head
george thought it would be nice to have it on his own head
he picked it up and put it on
the hat covered george's head 
he could not see
the man picked him up quickly and popped him into a bag
george was caught
the man with the big yellow hat put george into a little boat and a sailor rowed them both across the water to a big ship
george was sad but he was still a little curious
on the big ship things began to happen
the man took off the bag
george sat on a little stool and the man said 
george i am going to take you to a big zoo in a big city 
you will like it there
now run along and play but do not get into trouble
george promised to be good
but it is easy for little monkeys to forget
on the deck he found some sea gulls
he wondered how they could fly
he was very curious
finally he had to try
it looked easy
but what happened
first this
and then this
where is george
the sailors looked and looked
at last they saw him struggling in the water and almost all tired out
man overboard
the sailors cried as they threw him a life belt
george caught it and held on
at last he was safe on board
after that george was more careful to be a good monkey until at last
the long trip was over
george said good-by to the kind sailors and he and the man with the yellow hat walked off the ship on to the shore and on into the city to the man's house
after a good meal and a good pipe george felt very tired
he crawled into bed and fell asleep at once
the next morning the man telephoned the zoo
george watched him
he was fascinated
then the man went away
george was curious
he wanted to telephone too
one two three four five six seven
what fun
ding-a-ling-a-ling
george had telephoned the fire station
the firemen rushed to the telephone
hello hello
they said
but there was no answer
then they looked for the signal on the big map that showed where the telephone call had come from
they did not know it was george
they thought it was a real fire
hurry hurry hurry
the firemen jumped on to the fire engines and on to the hook-and-ladders
ding-dong-ding-dong
everyone out of the way
hurry hurry hurry
the firemen rushed into the house
they opened the door
no fire
only a naughty little monkey
oh catch him catch him
they cried
george tried to run away
he almost did but he got caught in the telephone wire and a thin fireman caught one arm and a fat fireman caught the other
you fooled the fire department
they said 
we will have to shut you up where you ca not do any more harm
they took him away and shut him in a prison
george wanted to get out
he climbed up to the window to try the bars
just then the watchman came in
he got on the wooden bed to catch george
but the watchman was too big and heavy
the bed tipped up the watchman fell over and quick as lightning george ran out through the open door
he hurried through the building and out on to the roof 
and then he was lucky to be a monkey
out he walked on to the telephone wires
quickly and quietly over the guard's head george walked away
he was free
down in the street outside the prison wall stood a balloon man
a little girl bought a balloon for her brother
george watched
he was curious again
he felt he must have a bright red balloon
he reached over and tried to help himself but instead of one balloon the whole bunch broke loose
in an instant the wind whisked them all away and with them went george holding tight with both hands
up up he sailed higher and higher
the houses looked like toy houses and the people like dolls
george was frightened
he held on very tight
at first the wind blew in great gusts
then it quieted
finally it stopped blowing altogether
george was very tired
down down he went - bump on to the top of a traffic light
everyone was surprised
the traffic got all mixed up
george did not know what to do and then he heard someone call 
george
he looked down and saw his friend the man with the big yellow hat
george was very happy
the man was happy too
george slid down the post and the man with the big yellow hat put him under his arm
then he paid the balloon man for all the balloons
and then george and the man climbed into the car and at last away they went to the zoo
what a nice place for george to live
