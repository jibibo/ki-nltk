here is edward bear
 coming downstairs now
 bump
 bump
 bump
 on the back of his head
 behind christopher robin
it is
 as far as he knows
 the only way of coming downstairs
 but sometimes he feels that there really is another way
 if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it
and then he feels that perhaps there is not
anyhow
 here he is at the bottom
 and ready to be introduced to you
winnie-the-pooh
when i first heard his name
 i said
 just as you are going to say
 
but i thought he was a boy?

so did i

said christopher robin

then you ca not call him winnie?

i do not.

but you said--

he is winnie-ther-pooh
do not you know what 'ther' means?

ah
 yes
 now i do

i said quickly; and i hope you do too
 because it is all the explanation you are going to get
sometimes winnie-the-pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs
 and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story
this evening-- 
what about a story?
said christopher robin

what about a story?
i said

could you very sweetly tell winnie-the-pooh one?

i suppose i could

i said

what sort of stories does he like?

about himself
because he is that sort of bear.

oh
 i see.

so could you very sweetly?

i'll try

i said
so i tried
once upon a time
 a very long time ago now
 about last friday
 winnie-the-pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of sanders

what does 'under the name' mean?
asked christopher robin

it means he had the name over the door in gold letters
 and lived under it.

winnie-the-pooh was not quite sure

said christopher robin

now i am

said a growly voice

then i will go on

said i
one day when he was out walking
 he came to an open place in the middle of the forest
 and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree
 and
 from the top of the tree
 there came a loud buzzingnoise
winnie-the-pooh sat down at the foot of the tree
 put his head between his paws and began to think
first of all he said to himself: 
that buzzing-noise means something
you do not get a buzzing-noise like that
 just buzzing and buzzing
 without its meaning something
if there is a buzzing-noise
 somebody is making a buzzing-noise
 and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that i know of is because you're a bee.
then he thought another long time
 and said: 
and the only reason for being a bee that i know of is making honey.
and then he got up
 and said: 
and the only reason for making honey is so as i can eat it.
so he began to climb the tree he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself
it went like this: is not it funny how a bear likes honey
buzz
buzz
buzz
i wonder why he does
then he climbed a little further


and a little further 


and then just a little further
by that time he had thought of another song
it is a very funny thought that
 if bears were bees
 they'd build their nests at the bottom of trees
and that being so (if the bees were bears)
 we should not have to climb up all these stairs
he was getting rather tired by this time
 so that is why he sang a complaining song
he was nearly there now
 and if he just stood on that branch 


crack

oh
 help!
said pooh
 as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him

if only i had not--
he said
 as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch

you see
 what i meant to do

he explained
 as he turned head-over-heels
 and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below
 
what i meant to do--

of course
 it was rather--
he admitted
 as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches

it all comes
 i suppose

he decided
 as he said good-bye to the last branch
 spun round three times
 and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush
 
it all comes of liking honey so much
oh
 help!
he crawled out of the gorse-bush
 brushed the prickles from his nose
 and began to think again
and the first person he thought of was christopher robin

was that me?
said christopher robin in an awed voice
 hardly daring to believe it

that was you.
christopher robin said nothing
 but his eyes got larger and larger
 and his face got pinker and pinker
so winnie-the-pooh went round to his friend christopher robin
 who lived behind a green door in another part of the forest

good morning
 christopher robin

he said

good morning
 winnie-ther-pooh

said you

i wonder if you've got such a thing as a balloon about you?

a balloon?

yes
 i just said to myself coming along: 'i wonder if christopher robin has such a thing as a balloon about him?' i just said it to myself
 thinking of balloons
 and wondering.

what do you want a balloon for?
you said
winnie-the-pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening
 put his paw to his mouth
 and said in a deep whisper: 
honey!

but you do not get honey with balloons!

i do

said pooh
well
 it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend piglet
 and you had balloons at the party
you had had a big green balloon; and one of rabbit is relations had had a big blue one
 and had left it behind
 being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you

which one would you like?
you asked pooh
he put his head between his paws and thought very carefully

it is like this

he said

when you go after honey with a balloon
 the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming
now
 if you have a green balloon
 they might think you were only part of the tree
 and not notice you
 and if you have a blue balloon
 they might think you were only part of the sky
 and not notice you
 and the question is: which is most likely?

would not they notice you underneath the balloon?
you asked

they might or they might not

said winnie-the-pooh

you never can tell with bees.
he thought for a moment and said: 
i shall try to look like a small black cloud
that will deceive them.
